          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> is an ancient game, dating back to at least the Han Dynasty &#28450;&#26397; (approximately, 206 BCE&ndash;220 CE). Now, it has come into the
          21<sup>st</sup>
          Century, burgeoned by a young, slightly obnoxious, artificial intelligence AI named Wintermute. Wintermute challenges <em>you</em> to a duel, promising to best you&mdash;as humankind's representative&mdash;at this most ancient example of
          human
          conflict resolution.
        </p>
        <p>There's a <em>slight</em> problem. Wintermute isn't quite as artificially intelligent as it is pretentious. It doesn't always get the rules right. In order to be smug and crush its little artificial dreams, you decide to document its
          errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a <strong>black-box testing</strong> approach, find the error(s) in Wintermute's logic. Because you don't know <em>how</em> Wintermute functions, you are restricted to
          testing predicted against actual outputs given each input. In other words, figure out when it gets the &ldquo;wrong answer&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scoring is kept by adding 1 point to your score for each hand (haha) you win, and 1 point to the computer's score for each hand Wintermute wins. Ties are worth nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, for those who may not know the rules, each player chooses a play (rock, paper, or scissors). The winner is determined as follows: rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. The diagram to the right conveys
          the same information.
